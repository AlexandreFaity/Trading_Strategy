# Trading_Strategy
A straightforward trading strategy based on the prediction of SPY

This strategy is based on the "Python and Statistics for Financial Analysis" course given by Xuhu Wan available on Coursera. The model is far from perfection and could be enhanced a lot.


However with the data that I used, the model doesn't fit and couldn' be used in real life.
